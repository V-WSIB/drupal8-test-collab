<p>The Insurable earnings and premium estimator for the construction industry estimates the insurable earnings and premium amounts for businesses in the construction sector.</p>
<p>To proceed you will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An estimate of the total annual insurable earnings for sole proprietors, partners, and executive officers, as well as gross insurable earnings for workers (Independent Operators must have their contracts/invoices for the current reporting period)</li>
    <li>Your WSIB Premium Remittance Form or the rate group numbers assigned to your WSIB account, if available. If you do not know your rate group number, review the rate group descriptions in the <a href="/node/26" target="_blank">WSIB's Employer Classification Manual</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>WSIB has made this online calculator available as a tool that you can use to learn how to estimate and calculate WSIB insurable earnings and premiums.

The online calculator will not retain any of the information entered into it and will not report any information to the WSIB.</p>
<p>Even if you use the online calculator note that employers still have an obligation to report their insurable earnings and pay their premiums to WSIB, either through conventional methods or ePremium.</p>

                    <dd><strong>Direct earnings</strong> are earnings that can be assigned to a rate group directly from records that clearly show the earnings by business activity. There are two types of direct earnings:<br />

                    <dd>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>To assign insurable earnings when the account has more than one rate group, you must maintain segregated earnings records for each rate group. The segregation of earnings must be based on the direct labour time spent on each business activity and must be verifiable through adequate records.<br />
                    <br />
                    An ancillary operation supports one or more business activities but is not itself classified separately, for example, administration related to the employer's business activity, such as administrative staff, payroll and human resources. </dd>
                    <dd><strong>Common earnings:</strong> For accounts with more than one rate group, common earnings are from ancillary operations that cannot be directly assigned to a single rate group and supported by segregated earnings records. These are called common earnings as they support more than one business activity and must be assigned to the relevant rate groups on a prorated basis over the direct earnings in each rate group.<br />
                    <br />
                    For firms with multiple rate groups and common earnings, the total insurable earnings for a rate group equals the rate group's direct earnings plus the prorated common earnings for the rate group.<br />
                    <br />
                    In order for the calculator to correctly pro-rate earnings, there must be direct worker earnings in all of the rate groups. If there are no direct worker earnings in any one of the rate groups, contact the WSIB to determine the best way to pro-rate the earnings and arrive at the correct premium amounts. </dd>

                    Labour portion </dd>
                    <dd>The WSIB considers the labour portion of the contracts or invoices of an Independent Operator to be insurable earnings for the purposes of calculating the premium and payment. There are two ways this dollar value can be obtained:<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. directly, when an Independent Operator keeps &quot;Adequate Records,&quot; or<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. derived, when an Independent Operator keeps &quot;Inadequate Records.&quot; </dd>
                    <dd class="bolded">1. Adequate records </dd>
                    <dd>When business records, Independent Operator's invoices, or written contracts accurately identify the actual labour portion of the contract by identifying the amounts allocated and billed for labour, and for materials, equipment and/or installation supplies, the labour portion is treated as the Independent Operator's gross insurable earnings.<br />
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Unless the terms of the contract specify that a truck or vehicle must be used in the direct performance of the construction work to be performed by the contractor, the WSIB does not allow a deduction for vehicle expenses. </dd>
                    <dd class="bolded">2. Inadequate records </dd>
                    <dd>When the business records are not adequate to identify the labour portion of the contract and there is no evidence that the Independent Operator supplied major materials and/or heavy construction equipment used in the direct performance of the construction work, the WSIB considers the entire contract value (100%) as the Independent Operator's gross insurable earnings.<br />
                    When the business records are not adequate to identify the labour portion of the contract and there is evidence that the Independent Operator supplied major materials, and/or heavy construction equipment, used in the direct performance of the construction work, the WSIB permits the Independent Operator to identify the labour portion using allowed percentages. </dd>

                    <dd>Direct earnings are earnings that can be assigned to a CU directly from records that clearly show the earnings by business activity. If one or more of your business activities has no direct earnings, please contact a WSIB account representative for assistance.<br />
                    To assign insurable earnings when the account has more than one CU, you must maintain segregated earnings records for each CU. The segregation of earnings must be based on the direct labour time spent on each business activity and must be verifiable through adequate records. </dd>

This amount is then pro-rated and reported to the WSIB according to the account frequency (e.g. monthly or quarterly).

                    If the executive officer receives regular insurable employment income (as described above) throughout the year, the employer will report the executive officer's actual insurable earnings for each reporting period. If the executive officer does not receive regular employment income throughout the year, the employer may estimate the amount of annual insurable earnings for each executive officer for the current reporting year. This amount is then pro-rated and reported to the WSIB according to the account frequency (e.g. monthly or quarterly). This estimate must meet or exceed the annual minimum amount of insurable earnings.<br />
                    <br />
                    The employer must ensure that all reported insurable earnings submitted to the WSIB for each executive officer is an accurate reflection of the actual insurable earnings. </dd>

                    <br />

These are called common earnings as they support more than one business activity and must be assigned to the relevant CUs on a pro-rated basis; these are typically the earnings of administrative and support staff.

                WSIB has made this online calculator available as a tool that you can use to learn how to estimate and calculate WSIB insurable earnings and premiums. This online calculator will work with the information that you provide. It is up to you to ensure the accuracy of the information that you enter. The online calculator will not retain any of the information entered into it and will not report any information to the WSIB.<br />
                <br />
                Even if you use the online calculator note that employers still have an obligation to report their insurable earnings and pay their premiums to WSIB, either through conventional methods or ePremium. You can report your insurable earnings to the WSIB using <a href="fGUID:835502100635000438|page:WSIBArticlePage" target="_blank">ePremium</a>.
